<!-- 10. The Coffee Machine: In your coffee shop application, you need to simulate the process of brewing coffee asynchronously. Write an async function named brewCoffee that takes the type of coffee and returns a promise. The promise should resolve with a message indicating that the coffee is ready after a random delay. -->

<body>

<script>
    function delay(min=1000, max=5000){

        return Math.floor(Math.random()* (max-min +1) + min);
    }

    async function brewCoffee(type) {

        return new Promise((resolve)=>{
            setTimeout(()=>{
                resolve(`Your Coffee ${type} is ready..`)
            },delay())
        })
        
    }
    (async function main() {
        console.log("Brewing Coffee ..") 
        let a=await brewCoffee("Cappucciao")
       console.log(a);
       console.log("Have a Good Day")
    })()
